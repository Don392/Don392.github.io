Human mobility prediction is a crucial task in various domains, including urban planning, traffic management, disaster risk reduction, and public health. However, accurately predicting intercity mobility remains challenging due to the complex correlations among flows and inherent spatiotemporal uncertainties. Recent advances in deep learning have improved prediction accuracy but often at the cost of increasing algorithmic complexity. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) only. By formulating human mobility prediction as a sequence generation task, our method efficiently adapts pre-trained LLMs to the competition dataset. Despite its simplicity, the proposed approach achieved competitive performance across all four regions, surpassing baseline methods. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs fine-tuned with SFT can effectively capture spatiotemporal dynamics and generalize across cities with minimal effort, providing a promising direction for efficient and transferable urban mobility modeling.
